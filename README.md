# Accessibility fixer-upper

## Overview

- *Fork this repository.*
- Debug all the issues both validation-wise and accessibility wise. *I suggest you start with the HTML validation.*
- There are lots of things wrong with the code: validation errors, tags missing, bad semantics, broken links, poor & missing accessibility features—all of them need to be found and fixed.
- *Run it through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.*

## Goal

Pass all of Markbot’s accessibility requirements and visually match the images in the “screenshots” folder.

- Final screenshots in the “screenshots” folder.

## Hand in

Drop this folder into your Markbot application. Make sure to fix all the errors. And submit to Canvas using Markbot.
